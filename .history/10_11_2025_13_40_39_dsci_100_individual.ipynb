    "I believe that kknn model is appropriate because it can caputure the non-linear relationship between played_hours and the patterns between the categorical variables of experience, gender, andd subscirber status.  The ultimate goal here is to predict whether explanatory variables, experince, gender, and subscriber status can predict how long a player spends in a game, as players who play longer will contrbute more data. Some limitations to kknn is that distance metrics may not be as accurate especially for categorical variables, making it harder to come to a firm prediction with full accuracy. \n",

    "For wrangling, the experience, gender, and subscriber variables should be converted to factors, making it easier for R to read. We will also need to get rid of the NAs by using the na.rm function.
